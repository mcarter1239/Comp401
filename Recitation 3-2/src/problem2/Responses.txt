1.) What makes you say your code isn't working?
	The initial output does not plot stars.
2.) What did you expect your code to do and why?
	I expect the code to create a new star map, plot three stars in it, print a text representation of the star map, remove a specific star from the map, then reprint the map with the star removed.  This is from following the main function.
3.) What did your code do instead and why?
	It did not create a star map (FIXED: this.height = height vs height = height and this.width = width vs width = width in constructor for star map).  When that was fixed it did not remove a star (FIXED: code was setting map[x][y] to zero instead of map[y][x]).
